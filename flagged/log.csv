Hypothesis: Light is refracted from air into water.
Material: Water tank and laser pointer.
Implementation: Shoot the laser pointer diagonally into the water in a dark room and observe the refracted light.
Observation: Light rays in the water are deflected in the normal direction compared to incident rays.
Results: Different media have different ability to refract light with air > water.",,,2023-05-26 10:00:17.515819
The light moves in a straight line.,Laser pointer and water tank.,Shoot the pointer from one side to another side of water tank.,Light ray travels straightly.,Light travels in a straight line.,True,"Form submitted successfully!

Hypothesis: The hypothesis of my experiment is: The light moves in a straight line., please check and evaluate it.

I have also tried to make the same assumption with other objects, such as mirrors or glass windows (see below). I've found that these are not affected by this effect either!


Material: The material of my experiment is: Laser pointer and water tank., please check and evaluate it.

I have a laser gun, which I use to shoot at the target with an electric beam from its tip (the ""laser""). The aim point for this shot was about 10 meters away in front or behind me; so that's where you can see how far off-target your shots are when they hit their targets!


Implementation: The implementation of my experiment is: Shoot the pointer from one side to another side of water tank., please check and evaluate it.

I have tested this with a few different types, but I think that most people will find them useful for their own experiments or as an example in your projects!
Observation: The observation of my experiment is: Light ray travels straightly., please check and evaluate it.
I have also tried to make the light rays as small as possible, but I still got some problems with them (see below).

Â In order for me not get any errors in this test you need a very good camera or lens that can handle such large amount(s). The best way would be using an old DSLR like Canon EOS 5D Mark II, Nikon D800E
Results: The results of my experiment is: Light travels in a straight line., please check and evaluate it.

I have also tried to find the best way for light rays, which are not reflected from objects but rather absorbed by them (like water), so that they can be used as an indicator when there's something on top or below you; this has been done with some success using mirrors placed at different heights above ground level where I could see through one mirror while another was visible under other ones.",,,2023-05-26 11:02:52.284398

Material: The material of my experiment is:, please check and evaluate it.

I have been working on this project for a while now, but I am still not sure if the results will be good enough to publish yet!
Implementation: The implementation of my experiment is:, please check and evaluate it.

I have created a simple script that will run the test suite, which can be found here (https://github-at/testsuite). It's not very complex but I think you'll find this useful for testing your code in production environments or just to see how things work out when running tests on different machines with various configurations. The scripts are written using Python 3 so they should compile fine without any changes if installed
Observation: The observation of my experiment is:, please check and evaluate it.

I have not yet found a way to make the system work without using some kind, but I am sure that there are many ways in which this could be done (and probably will be).
Results: The results of my experiment is:, please check and evaluate it.

I have tried to make the code as simple, readable & easy-to read as possible for you guys! I hope that this will help a lot in your own experiments with Python 3 or 4 :)
